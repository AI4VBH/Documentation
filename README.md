# The London Medical Imaging & AI Centre for Value-based Healthcare

Artificial Intelligence (AI) improves healthcare by helping to deliver earlier diagnosis and better treatment based on accumulated learning far beyond even the most experienced clinician.

AI will help the NHS increase efficiency, improve therapies, drive safety, and reduce costs all of which benefit patients, medical staff, and the wider society. It is one of the most exciting and inspiring areas of healthcare currently being researched and developed, and itâ€™s our mission, at the AI Centre, to spearhead innovation and opportunities for the NHS both now and in the future. We are a team of AI, data science, research, and clinical experts working collaboratively across academic institutions, the NHS and industry organisations. By focusing on AI and advanced imaging, we will improve patient care by diagnosing conditions earlier and tailoring treatment to a particular patient using intelligent systems.
